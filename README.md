# Vietnamese Word Segmentation using CRF

A comprehensive Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based solution for Vietnamese word segmentation that converts unsegmented text (without spaces and diacritics) into properly segmented text with word boundaries.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Vietnamese word segmentation is a challenging NLP task where the goal is to identify word boundaries in continuous text. This project specifically addresses the conversion from:

- **Input**: Text without spaces and diacritics (e.g., "xinchao")
- **Output**: Properly segmented text (e.g., "xin chao")

This is particularly useful for processing informal text, transliterated Vietnamese, or text from sources where diacritics and proper spacing have been lost.

## 🧠 CRF-Based Approach

### Why CRF for Word Segmentation?

**Conditional Random Fields (CRF)** are particularly well-suited for sequence labeling tasks like word segmentation because they:

1. **Model sequential dependencies**: CRF can capture dependencies between adjacent labels, crucial for understanding word boundaries
2. **Handle rich feature sets**: Can incorporate multiple types of features (character-level, positional, dictionary-based)
3. **Provide global optimization**: Unlike local classifiers, CRF finds the globally optimal label sequence
4. **Work well with limited data**: Effective even with moderately-sized training datasets

### Technical Implementation

#### BIES Tagging Scheme

The model uses the BIES (Begin-Inside-End-Single) tagging scheme:

- **B**: Beginning of a word
- **I**: Inside a word (continuation)
- **E**: End of a word
- **S**: Single character word

Example:

```
Input:  x i n c h a o
Labels: B I E B I I E
Output: xin chao
```

#### Feature Engineering

The CRF model leverages rich feature extraction:

1. **Character-level features**:

   - Unigrams: Current character
   - Bigrams: Character pairs (previous+current, current+next)
   - Trigrams: Character triplets for wider context

2. **Positional features**:

   - Beginning of sequence (BOS)
   - End of sequence (EOS)
   - Relative position indicators

3. **Character type features**:

   - Alphabetic vs numeric
   - Case information
   - Special character detection

4. **Dictionary-based features**:
   - Word boundary hints from known vocabulary
   - Length-based word matching (1-8 characters)
   - Frequency-based word preferences

#### Model Architecture

```
Input Text → Feature Extraction → CRF Layer → BIES Labels → Word Reconstruction
```

The CRF uses L-BFGS optimization with L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Deep Dive

The CRF model's strength comes from its rich feature representation:

```python
# Example features for character 'h' in "xinchao"
features = {
    'char': 'h',                    # Current character
    'char.lower': 'h',              # Lowercase version
    'char-1': 'c',                  # Previous character
    'char+1': 'a',                  # Next character
    'bigram-1': 'ch',               # Previous bigram
    'bigram+1': 'ha',               # Next bigram
    'trigram-2': 'nch',             # Previous trigram
    'trigram+2': 'hao',             # Next trigram
    'dict_match_2': True,           # "ha" in dictionary
    'dict_match_3': True,           # "hao" in dictionary
    'BOS': False,                   # Not beginning of sequence

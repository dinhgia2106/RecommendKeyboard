# Ultimate Vietnamese Keyboard

A dual-AI architecture for real-time Vietnamese text input enhancement using ViBERT and Vietnamese Accent Marker models.

## Overview

The Ultimate Vietnamese Keyboard represents a significant advancement in Vietnamese text input systems, achieving 97-100% accuracy on critical Vietnamese patterns while maintaining sub-3ms response times for instant patterns. The system employs a novel dual-AI architecture that combines semantic understanding with specialized accent prediction to provide superior typing assistance.

## Key Features

### Dual-AI Architecture

- **ViBERT Integration**: Native Vietnamese BERT model (FPTAI/vibert-base-cased) for semantic understanding
- **Accent Marker**: XLM-RoBERTa model (peterhung/vietnamese-accent-marker-xlm-roberta) for diacritical mark prediction
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent model execution for optimal performance

### Performance Characteristics

- **Instant Response**: Sub-3ms processing for exact pattern matches
- **High Accuracy**: 97-100% accuracy on critical Vietnamese patterns
- **Rich Suggestions**: 15+ contextually relevant suggestions per query
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 143 core Vietnamese patterns across multiple categories

### Pattern Categories

- Basic vocabulary (26 patterns)
- Time expressions (16 patterns)
- Personal pronouns with actions (47 patterns)
- School and work contexts (18 patterns)
- Extended vocabulary (36 patterns)

## Technical Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

```
Input Text → Pattern Matching → ViBERT Processing → Accent Marker → Hybrid Segmentation → Ultimate Ranking
```
